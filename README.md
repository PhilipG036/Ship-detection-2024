Abstract:

Maritime safety and security are paramount concerns in various domains, including
marine traffic control and anti-illegal fishing. Accurate ship detection plays a critical role in
ensuring the success of operations aimed at safeguarding our seas. In this study, we explore
the application of deep learning (DL) techniques, specifically YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7,
and YOLOv8, to enhance ship detection accuracy and decrease errors. By leveraging the
adaptability and efficiency of these DL models, we aim to address the complexities inherent in
maritime environments and contribute to the advancement of maritime safety and security
measures. A key component of our approach involves the acquisition and utilization of a
standardized dataset for training and evaluating the DL models. We recognize the fundamental
importance of a reliable dataset in developing robust ship detection systems. Through
meticulous dataset curation and preprocessing, we ensure the integrity and broad applicability
of our models.

By harnessing the capabilities of DL models trained on high-quality datasets, we seek
to improve the precision and reliability of ship identification, thus enhancing monitoring
capabilities and expediting incident response times in maritime operations.Our study yields
promising results, demonstrating the effectiveness of DL-based ship detection systems in
strengthening maritime safety and security. By leveraging state-of-the-art DL techniques, we
achieve notable improvements in ship recognition accuracy and error reduction. These
findings underscore the potential of DL-driven technologies to safeguard our seas and aquatic
activities effectively. Through continuous refinement and application of advanced DL
methodologies, we aim to further optimize maritime surveillance systems and contribute to the
protection of marine ecosystems and resources.
